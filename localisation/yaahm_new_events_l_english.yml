Open rebellion is common, and even the lowliest peasant is known to keep a sharpened pitchfork in his shed.\n\nAnd in the Lowlands, some speak of your cousin, the [FLA.Monarch.GetTitle] of [FLA.GetName], and [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHis] ruthless ways. \"The Invader,\" they call [FLA.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nYour Majesty, I would not write to you if I were not so deeply troubled, not only for your well-being, but for the well-being of your people. We are doing the best we can to stifle dissent and reassure the peasantry that all will be well, but we fear our wo---ma--------lling on de----ar----.\n\n---odspee----,\n\nYo------mbl------ssal...\"\n\nThe rest of the note is illegible, a jumbled mess of strokes and tears in the parchment."
