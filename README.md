# War of the Lilies, by neothiamin

A mod for Europa Universalis 4 centered around an English victory in the Hundred Years' War. Key features include an earlier start date (1435), new nations, new province history, new missions, new events, lots of new things!

Feature requests and bug reports go onto the issue tracker. No support will be given for in-dev versions of the mod (meaning, if you download a zip of the mod that was not made by me, I will not give you help or take bug reports from you. They're in-dev for a reason!)
